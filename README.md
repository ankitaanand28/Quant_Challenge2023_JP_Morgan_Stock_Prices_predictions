# Quant_Challenge2023_JP_Morgan_Stock_Prices_predictions
This is my submission of Quant Challenge ML segment 2023. I was among the top 6 candidates in the final round.

I was provided with train and test datasets separately containing simulated stock prices and I was asked to predict the prices of stocks in test dataset.
<h3> Here is my Model Architecture</h3>
